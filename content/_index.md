# Hi there! 
# I'm Jibran, a web developer based in <span class="dubai">Dubai</span>

I currently work at <a href="https://myfelix.com" target="_blank">Felix</a>, an insure-tech startup. We are the regions first fully digital insurance brokerage. We are trying to be the Zappos of the insurance world, aiming to **Deliver Happiness** with every interaction. 

Seriously, we are hella focused on providing the <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/myfelix.com" target="_blank">best customer service possible</a>.

And while I'm very proud and happy of my day job, that's all I'm going to talk about it. This site is about me!

## Who am I?
I'm a 30ish guy from Pakistan, who moved to Dubai in 2013 to work on some wicked cool web development projects. In the time I have been here, I have had the good luck of working with the badass teams at:

- <a href="https://dubai.dubizzle.com" target="_blank">Dubizzle</a> &ndash; the biggest classifieds platform in the Middle East region. I worked as a junior software developer here.
- <a href="https://www.justproperty.com" target="_blank">JustProperty.com</a> &ndash; one of the largest property listings portal here in the UAE. I worked as a technical team lead here.
- <a href="https://myfelix.com" target="_blank">MyFelix</a> &ndash; the insurance brokerage of the future. I'm the head of technology here.

My primary web development tool is the Django framework using the Python language. I am also the DevOps guy in my current job. Not only do I know how to build an application, I also know how to deploy it to the cloud. How cool is that!

## What else?
I've written a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Django-Project-Blueprints-Jibran-Ahmed/dp/1783985429" target="_blank">book on Django</a>. It's not the most positively received book out there, but it was my first shot at writing something of this size, and I'm *very* proud of the fact that I completed and published it. Maybe someday I'll write another one which will be better. Not sure yet.

I occasionally blog <a href="https://blog.asadjb.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. But I'm not regular with it. When I have a thought that I *just need* to get onto paper (or screen here) I write. But I don't follow any set interval for blogging.

I also like photography, and when I occasionally travel, I like to take a lot of photographs and put them <a href="https://50mm.asadjb.com" target="_blank">online</a>.
