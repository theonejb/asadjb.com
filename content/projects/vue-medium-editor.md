As the title pretty much says, it's a Vue 1.x component to integrate a Medium like editor into your Vue app.

I was working on creating a simple CMS for a personal project, and decided to use the opportunity to learn the Vue frontend framework as well. My first roadblock was to integrate a good WYSIWYG HTML editor into the app.

I played around with a few and finally settled on a clone of the Medium editor. However, it wasn't available as a Vue component, which made things *interesting*!

So I built this integration. And while the project I was working on is now long forgotten; I don't even remember what it was, this small component is still alive.
